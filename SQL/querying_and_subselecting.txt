* Searching within a result set using WHERE

SELECT * FROM album
  WHERE id IN (SELECT DISTINCT album_id FROM track WHERE duration <= 90)
;

* Creating a VIEW to visualize the data table

CREATE VIEW trackView AS
  SELECT id, album_id, title, track_number,

SELECT * FROM trackView;

* Deleting or dropping a view

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS trackView;

* Visualize a joined VIEW
